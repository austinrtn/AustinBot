
//Welcome to AustinBotScript.txt.  In this txt file, all the text will be read by the GenerateResponse.readABS scanner
//ABS being short for AustinBotScript.  This script contains a very basic syntax, but makes it very efficient to
//create Phrase objects within AustinBot.

//Triggers (the String that the program compares to the user input) begin with a + sign, are separated by commas and end with a semicolon.
//Outputs begin with a - sign, are separated by commas and end with a semicolon.
//The typeOfTrig begins with a * sign, contains a letter (c for conversation, e for exact, p for partial) and ends with a semicolon.
//Commands are added with an = sign, contains the number of the index of the Command within the getCommandFrom List method in 
//Command.java, and ends with a semicolon (if no command, do not add = sign).
//Each Phrase object should be ended by the word end followed by a semicolon.
//Comments can be written with two forward slashes and will be ignored by the program.
//All phrases should be written in lowercase and should not use contractions.  Triggers should not contain punctuation other than the ABS syntax.

//EXAMPLE
//+trigger 1, trigger 2;
//-output 1, output 2;
//*e;
//end; 

//In conversations, the trigger's indexes should correspond according to the conversation
//For example: trigger 0 should correspond with output 0, trigger 1 should correspond with output 1 ect.
//In exact or partial phrases, any of the triggers can be matched with the user input, and one the outputs of the phrase will be randomly displayed.

//EXAMPLE 2 (CONVERSATION)
//+what is your favorite band, 'insert band here';
//-my favorite band is The Beatles.  What's yours?, That's a good band.;
//*e;
//end;
